Agent_Manager receives a Problem to solve (the Problem contains names of files and agents,
each agent from the list makes computations using data from all data files on the list)
from a GUI agent, it divides it to single tasks (agent - data),
which are afterwards sent to an Agent_OptionsManager (Agent_Random),
who chooses random values of (some of) the agents options, sends them to a Computing_Agent,
receives the reply (result of the computation with given options),
and keeps iterating until the errorRate is smaller than 0.3.
