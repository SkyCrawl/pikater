Agent_Manager asks a Computing_Agent "mp1" (works only for Agent_MultilayerPerceptron) for his weka Options,
then sends them to an Agent_OptionsManager (Agent_Random),
who chooses random values of these options, sends them to a Computing_Agent,
receives the reply (result of the computation with given options), and keeps iterating until the errorRate is smaller than 0.3.
