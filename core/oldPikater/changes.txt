Most important changes:

*Ontology*
 - Computation and Compute ontology classes no longer exist,
   Task is used instead
 - new ontology class Id created

*Manager*
 - if there is ? in the options, creates Options manager agent,
   else sends Task directly to Computing agent (debugged - ok)
 - in both cases manager uses Contract Net Initiator behaviour,
   sends the same Execute as the content of both CFP and ACCEPT-PROPOSAL messages

 TODO
 - manager chooses just one OptionsManager / Computing Agent
 - improve management of computing agents (recently if n computing agents is
   requested by Option Manager, n computing agents is assiged,
   these agent are held in BusyAgents list)

*Computing Agent*
 - responds to Contract Net protocol, sends lenght of its Task queue as proposal
 - always returns Task list (with Evaluations filled in) in an INFORM message
 - uses new Evaluation with list of Evals

 TODO
 - use of the search agent for training (Bob part is missing, see dirty_picture.pdf)
 - saving results to database directly by computing agent

*Options Manager*
 - understands CFPs from manager
 - returns list of Tasks
 - sends GET-AGENTS request to manager, receives list of AIDs
 - uses Contract Net Initiator behaviour when communicating with computing agents

 TODO
 - debugged until sending REQUEST message to Search agent
 - always sends "0" as proposal to CFP from manager
