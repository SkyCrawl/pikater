TODO: too technical...

Table views are defined in the following packages:

1. `org.pikater.shared.database.views`  
Contains data source definitions for views.
2. `org.pikater.web.vaadin.gui.server.components.dbviews`  
Contains GUI implementation that transforms the above data sources into a table.

Altogether, they form "table DB view framework". It is quite configurable and specially designed to be easily modified in various ways.
